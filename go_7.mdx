Structures and Methods

---
A Structure is a **User Defined Type**

---

<CodeSurfer>

```go title="Defining Structures"
package main

import "fmt"

type person struct {
    name string
    age  int
}

```
```diff 5:8 subtitle="We declare Structures siliar to this"
```
```diff 5[1:5,13:19] subtitle="We use the Keyword 'type' followed with the structure name and the 'struct' keyword to define its a structure"
```
```diff 6,7 subtitle="We need to define the types of structure variables too"
```

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type person struct {
    name string
    age  int
}
func main() {
    fmt.Println(person{"Bob", 20})

    fmt.Println(person{name: "Alice", age: 30})

    fmt.Println(person{name: "Fred"})

    s := person{name: "Sean", age: 50}
    fmt.Println(s.name)
    s.name="Linus"
    fmt.Println(s.name)
}
```
```diff 10,12,14,16 subtitle="We can assign values to structures via these methods"
```
```diff 14 subtitle="Here the 'age' data will be autmatically set to zero"
```
```diff 17 subtitle="The data from structures are accessed with the ' . '(dot) operator"
```
```diff 18,19 title="https://play.golang.org/p/FxrWEShcRsW" subtitle="Structs are mutable. You can update the value anytime"
```

## Methods

---
A Method is a function with a special receiver argument

---

<CodeSurfer>

```go title="Defining Methods and Usage"
package main

import "fmt"

type Employee struct {  
    name     string
    salary   int
    currency string
}

func (e Employee) displaySalary() {  
    fmt.Printf("Salary of %s is %s%d", e.name, e.currency, e.salary)
}

func main() {  
    emp := Employee {
        name:     "Athul Cyriac",
        salary:   5000,
        currency: "$",
    }
    emp.displaySalary() 
}
```

```diff 5:10 subtitle="We're defining the Employee structure here"
```
```diff 11:13 subtitle="We're defining the method displaySalary here"
```
```diff 11 subtitle="We're defining the method with e as the receiver type. Therefore this method only works on the Employee struct"
```
```diff 21 subtitle="Calling displaySalary() method of Employee type"
```
```diff 11:22 title="https://play.golang.org/p/V3QAJG7TSOc" subtitle="Structures and Methods work like oop proceedings in Go"
```

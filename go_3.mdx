# Day 3 - Go Track

We'll talk about 
- Conditionals
- Switch
- Loops

---

## Conditionals
- `if`
- `if-else-if`
- `if-else`
- `switch`

---

<CodeSurfer>

```go title="IF condition in Go" 
package main

import "fmt"

func main(){
    if 8%4 == 0 {
        fmt.Println("8 is divisible by 4")
    }
}
```
```diff 6[5,6] subtitle="If conditions are defined by the if keyword"
```
```diff 6[7:18] subtitle="'if' conditions in Go doesn't need a paranthesis to define the condition. You can use if without else in Go "
```
```diff 6[17],7,8 subtitle="but for the body { } are a must"
```

```go title="If-Else condition"
package main

import "fmt"

func main(){
    if 7%2 == 0 {
        fmt.Println("7 is even")
    }else {
        fmt.Println("7 is odd")
    }
}
```
```diff 8[6:10] subtitle="'else' is defined from the end of the 'if' statement without a line break"
```
```diff 8[6:12],9,10 subtitle="Else block also should be enclosed within { }"
```
```go title="If-Elseif-Else"
package main

import "fmt"

func main(){
    if num:=9; num<0{
        fmt.Println(num, "is negative")
    }else if num<10{
        fmt.Println(num, "has 1 digit")
    }else{
        fmt.Println(num, "has multiple digits")
    }
}
```
```diff 6:12 subtitle="Else-if used same way else is."
```
```diff 8[6:13] title="https://play.golang.org/p/4U4dR541Mpu" subtitle="There is only a space dividing else and if"
```

## Switch

---

<CodeSurfer>

```go title="Switch in Go"
package main

import "fmt"

func main(){
	i := 2
	fmt.Print("Write ", i, " as ")
	switch i {
	case 1:
		fmt.Println("one")
	case 2:
		fmt.Println("two")
	case 3:
		fmt.Println("three")
    default:
        fmr.Println("No idea")
	}
}
```

```diff 8 subtitle="We're running the switch on the variable 'i' "
```

```diff 9,11,13 subtitle="Switch cases are checked with the 'case' keyword"
```

```diff 15,16 subtitle="There is a 'default' keyword if the condition is not withing the switch"
```

## Loops
- Go has only one looping concept `for`

---

<CodeSurfer>

```go title="For loops"
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	sum := 1
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++{
		sum += i
	}
	fmt.Println(sum)
}
```
```diff 7[9:27] subtitle="for loops in go are similar to loops in C/C++"
```
```diff 7 subtitle="For loops in go also doesn't need any parathesis around the components"
```
```diff 7[28],8,9 subtitle="But the loop body should be in paranthesis '( )'"
```
```go title="For as While" subtitle="In go, for loops are also used as while loops"
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	sum := 1
	for sum < 1000 {
		sum += sum
	 }
	fmt.Println(sum)
}
```
```go title="Infinite for loop"
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	for {
        fmt.Println("loop")
        break
    }
}
```
```diff 6,8 subtitle="There is no condition here, but the 'break' keyword will stop the execution of the loop"
```

## Thats all for Today. We learned
- Conditionals- if,else,else-if,switch
- Loops - for
- Assignment - **Build a Calculator app with switch**
(Operators are same as in every programming lang)
